# Numerical Reasoning for KBQA

In the [previous work](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.159/), we propose a pretrained numerical reasoning model for KBQA but its performance is limited for the non-numerical questions. Recently we extend the numerical reasoning model by using pre-training tasks and template-based data augmentation and we observe significant improvements in our experiments. The draft of this work is available at [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06109.pdf), which will be submitted to a journal soon.
